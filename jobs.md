# LDT Sorry Elimination — Status Report

Last updated: 2026-04-12

## Progress Summary
- **Started**: 66 sorrys across 9 files in `MIPStarRE/LDT/`
- **Current**: 30 executable sorrys across 7 files
- **Eliminated**: 36 executable sorrys
- **Infrastructure fixes landed on this branch**:
  - `SymStrat.IsGood` and `RestrictedSymStrat.IsGood` now carry `PermInvState`
  - shared `SliceBoundednessInput` for Section 11/12 theorem interfaces
  - averaged point-operator defs moved out of induction-local scope
- **PRs already recorded in this file**: 3

## Active Strategy
- Highest-leverage live chain is now Section 12 pasting.
- Immediate target cluster: `Pasting/Theorems.lean` around
  `commutativitySwitcheroo` and its local helper bridges.
- Refined switcheroo proof shape: use two cancelling center expressions
  (`G \otimes M` for the first/third terms and `M \otimes G` for the second/fourth
  terms) rather than a single common center. This avoids needing an extra
  `PermInvState` hypothesis in `commutativitySwitcheroo`.
- Narrow live blocker in the generic switcheroo theorem: the second
  switch-sandwich step wants complete-part self-consistency of `G`, but the
  current hypothesis package `GCompleteSelfConsistencyStatement` only stores the
  stronger slice-family relation in a form that can be pushed down to the
  complete part only with `PermInvState`.
- Reason: this is the lowest remaining live dependency spine to `ldPasting`,
  `ldPastingInInductionSection`, and `mainInduction` that still looks provable
  with current infrastructure.
- Secondary live track: Section 11 `commDataProcessedG` local bridge lemmas,
  which appear to need one new questionwise reduction lemma rather than a major
  theorem-statement repair.

## Agent Board
- Survey agent: refreshed executable-sorry count and file-by-file breakdown.
- Proof agent A: assigned to `Pasting.commutativitySwitcheroo` proof shape and
  triangle-composition route.
- Proof agent A status: actively implementing `Pasting.commutativitySwitcheroo`;
  current subtask is the four-term `qSDDOp` expansion with two-center
  cancellation.
- Proof agent A blocker: generic `commutativitySwitcheroo` does not currently
  expose the complete-part self-consistency witness needed for the second
  switch-sandwich bound; this witness is derivable later for `SymStrat` states
  via `PermInvState`, but not from the theorem's present hypotheses alone.
- Proof agent B: assigned to local helper subgoals in the same cluster:
  `completePartProjFamily.proj`,
  `pointWithCompletePart_as_switcheroo_input`,
  `completePartAggregateCommutation_as_total`.
- Refactor agent: reserved for transport/reindex lemmas and definitional
  cleanups if the Pasting proof gets stuck on non-definitional equalities.
- Proof agent C: assigned to Section 11 `commDataProcessedG.stabilityOne`
  questionwise reduction and normalization-condition route.
- Integration agent: reserved for file builds and reprioritization after each
  landed proof.

## Files Now Clean
- `SelfImprovement/Theorems.lean`
- `ExpansionHypercubeGraph/Theorems.lean`

## Recent Progress On This Pass
- Opened PR #333 for the current Pasting transport/scaffold pass.
- Opened PR #326 for the Worktree 2 Section 9 tracker refresh.
- `SelfImprovement/Defs.lean`, `SelfImprovement/MatrixRealization.lean`, and
  `SelfImprovement/Theorems.lean` re-scanned: 0 executable
  `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom` placeholders remain.
- `SelfImprovement/Theorems.lean`: confirmed current executable closure relies on
  reduced Section 9 scaffolding (`sdp`, `addInU`, `SelfImprovementBridgePackage`)
  rather than missing local proofs.
- Reprioritized away from Section 9 and back onto the live Section 12 pasting
  chain.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:commutativitySwitcheroo` proof route refined against the
  paper: the Lean proof should cancel two separate center terms rather than rely
  on an unneeded symmetry assumption.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:commutativitySwitcheroo` now contains the explicit
  two-center proof scaffold in code, and the first switch-sandwich transfer
  bound (`M` self-consistency to the `G \otimes M` center) is formalized and
  typechecked.
- Isolated the precise generic switcheroo blocker: the missing witness is
  complete-part self-consistency of `G`, equivalently the bipartite SSC input
  for the one-outcome projective family `x ↦ G^x`.
- `Preliminaries/Theorems.lean`: added
  `consRelDataProcessing_questionDependent`, a question-dependent postprocessing
  theorem for `ConsRel`; this is intended to support later corollaries such as
  `Pasting.hAConsistency` where the evaluation map depends on the sampled point.
- `Preliminaries/Theorems.lean`: added `consRel_uniform_equiv`, reindexing
  `ConsRel` along an equivalence of uniformly sampled question spaces. This is
  another transport lemma needed for moving between `Point params.next` and
  `(Point params) × (Fq params)` style formulations.
- `lake build MIPStarRE.LDT.Pasting.Theorems` now completes successfully in this
  workspace, so single-file proof iteration is warm.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:completePartProjFamily.proj` proved.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:pointWithCompletePart_as_switcheroo_input` proved.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean`: extracted
  `switcherooAggregateLeft_completePart_outcome` and
  `switcherooAggregateRight_completePart_outcome` helper lemmas.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean`: repaired the false second switcheroo comparison to
  the paper-correct `θ₁ -> θ₂ -> ν₂` chain inside `commutingWithGComplete`.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:firstSwitcherooError_le_commutingWithGCompleteError`
  proved under explicit small-error assumptions.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:firstSwitcherooError_le_eighth_stage` proved.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:secondSwitcherooError_le_commutingWithGCompleteError`
  proved under the same explicit small-error assumptions.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:commutingWithGComplete` now explicitly carries the
  paper's small-error regime hypotheses `(0 ≤ gamma ≤ 1)`, `(0 ≤ zeta ≤ 1)`,
  and `params.d ≤ params.q`.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean:completePartAggregateCommutation_as_total` proved.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean`: added local switcheroo support helpers
  `switcherooSelfConsistency_bip`,
  `switcherooCompletePartSelfConsistency_bip`, and
  `avgOver_uniform_slicePair`.
- `Pasting/Theorems.lean` now has 11 executable `sorry`s remaining in this file.

## What Was Attempted But Could Not Be Proved

### Investigated and found unprovable/blocked:
- **orthonormalizationMainLemma_error_bound**: Was FALSE as stated (counterexample at ζ=625). Fixed by adding ζ ≤ 1 hypothesis.
- **QXPLayer matrix identities (qaRestated, xSquared, etc.)**: Were unprovable without structure fields. Fixed by adding invariant fields to QXPLayerData.
- **Commutativity/Theorems.lean G type mismatch**: Pre-existing type error. Fixed.
- **GlobalVariance aggregate SDDRel**: Blocked by private averaging constructor. Fixed by making it public.
- **SelfImprovement 4 sorrys**: All genuinely blocked on missing SDP/orthonormalization infrastructure.
- **ExpansionHypercubeGraph 3 matrix proofs**: Need non-trivial finite-sum trace-expansion infrastructure.
- **Pasting gHatFacts 2 subgoals**: Hypothesis direction mismatch (need per-outcome qSDD, have aggregated).
- **Pasting second switcheroo scalar bound**: original theorem statement was false; the
  branch now follows the paper's intermediate `θ₁`/`θ₂` error chain instead.

### Agents dispatched (18 total across waves):
- Wave 1: 6 survey/assessment agents
- Wave 2: 6 infrastructure fix + proof agents
