# Spectral truncation statement conversions

This file contains the structural conversions between the rounded-projector
witness used by the QXP rank-reduction layer and the
`SpectralTruncationStatement` interface used by orthonormalization.

The conversions are field-for-field copies.  The constructive spectral
truncation theorem, which produces such a rounded projective family from the
paper's almost-projective hypothesis, is proved in the sibling proof-layer
module `SpectralTruncation.ProjectiveNonMeasurement`.

/-! ### Spectral truncation statement conversion

Convert a `RoundingToProjectorsWitness` to a `SpectralTruncationStatement`.
The two types are field-for-field identical after `SpectralTruncationStatement.closeness`
was weakened to `2√ζ`. -/

/-- Convert a `RoundingToProjectorsWitness` to a `SpectralTruncationStatement`.

This is a structural field-for-field copy: both types carry the same data
(rounded family, projectivity, `2√ζ` closeness, total bound `1 + 2√ζ`).

The mathematical content of `lem:projective-non-measurement` — constructing
the rounded family — is the caller's responsibility when building a
`RoundingToProjectorsWitness`. -/

Convert a spectral-truncation statement back to the rounded-projector
witness consumed by the QXP rank-reduction layer.

**Source:** This is a source-faithful structural conversion of the rounded-family
conclusion of the cited lemma. It does not recover the source almost-projective
estimate, because that estimate is not a field of `SpectralTruncationStatement`;
rank-reduction constructors which need it therefore keep it as a separate
hypothesis. -/

/-! ### Rank-reduction from spectral truncation -/

/-- Feed a spectral-truncation statement into the QXP rank-reduction layer.

The statement `SpectralTruncationStatement` remembers the rounded projectors
and their distance from the source measurement.  The rank-reduction witness also
records the source almost-projectivity estimate, so that estimate remains an
explicit hypothesis here.  This is the precise interface needed when the
orthonormalization spectral input is followed by the paper's
`Q -> X -> Xhat -> P` repair layer. -/

/-- **Rank reduction** (`\label{lem:projective-low-rank-sum}`).

Paper origin: `references/ldt-paper/orthonormalization.tex:540-658`.

The paper first applies `\label{lem:projective-non-measurement}` to obtain the
rounded projective family `R_a`, and then performs the rank-reduction argument.
This theorem keeps that source-facing boundary: the rounded family is produced
internally from the source almost-projectivity estimate and is then passed to
the internal constructor `projectiveLowRankSum_of_roundingWitness`. -/
