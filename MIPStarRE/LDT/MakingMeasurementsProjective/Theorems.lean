# Section 5 — Theorems

Theorem statements and proofs for Naimark dilation and orthonormalization.

## Proof structure

### Naimark dilation

1. **One-measurement Naimark** (`oneMeasNaimark`): For any submeasurement
   `M` on `Op d`, there exists a projective submeasurement on `Op (d × Option α)`
   preserving all expectation values. This is Lemma 5.2 of the paper.
   The proof constructs an isometry using matrix square roots and verifies
   the compression identity.

2. **Full Naimark** (`naimark`): Apply one-measurement Naimark independently
   to each question on each side (Theorem 5.1). The full lifted state is
   the original state tensored with all per-question auxiliary pure states.
   Correlation preservation follows from the tensor-product structure:
   since different questions use disjoint auxiliary registers, the
   per-question dilation identities compose.

### Orthonormalization

The orthonormalization lemma (`orthonormalization`) converts approximately
self-consistent submeasurements to projective ones, following the
Kempe–Vidick argument. The proof proceeds through:
1. Consistency → almost-projective (`consistencyToAlmostProjective`)
2. Spectral truncation (`spectralTruncateAlmostProjective`)
3. Rounding to projective (`adjustTruncatedProjections`)

/-! ### One-measurement Naimark (Lemma 5.2) -/

/-- **One-measurement Naimark lemma** (Lemma 5.2).

For any submeasurement `M : Submeasurement α d`, there exists a projective
submeasurement on the enlarged space `d × Option α` such that for every
operator `ρ` on `Op d` and outcome `a`:
`τ(ρ · M_a) = τ'(ρ_lifted · P̂_a)`
where `ρ_lifted = |Option α| · (ρ ⊗ |⊥⟩⟨⊥|)` and `P̂_a` is the
dilated projector.

**Proof sketch**: Let `V|ψ⟩ = ∑_a √M_a|ψ⟩ ⊗ |a⟩ + √(I−M)|ψ⟩ ⊗ |⊥⟩`.
This is an isometry (by the submeasurement property `∑ M_a ≤ I`).
Define `P̂_a = V†(I ⊗ |a⟩⟨a|)V`. Then `P̂_a` is an orthogonal projection
(since `|a⟩⟨a|` is), and the compression identity
`(I⊗⟨⊥|) P̂_a (I⊗|⊥⟩) = √M_a · √M_a = M_a` gives the result.

The proof requires matrix square roots for PSD operators, which are
available in principle via the spectral theorem but require nontrivial
Mathlib infrastructure. -/
/- TODO: The proof requires matrix square roots for PSD operators (via spectral theorem)
   and Mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef.sqrt`. See #98 for tracking. The construction is:
   1. Build isometry V using √M_a and √(I − ∑M_a)
   2. Define P̂_a = V†(I ⊗ |a⟩⟨a|)V and verify IsProj
   3. Verify compression identity: (I⊗⟨⊥|)P̂_a(I⊗|⊥⟩) = M_a

/-! ### Full Naimark dilation (Theorem 5.1) -/

/-- **Naimark dilation theorem** (Theorem 5.1, `thm:naimark`).

For any state `ψ` and submeasurements `A`, `B` on space `ι`, there exist
projective measurements `Â`, `B̂` on the enlarged space
`ι × (QuestionA → Option OutcomeA) × (QuestionB → Option OutcomeB)`
and a lifted state `ψ̂` such that all correlations are preserved:
`⟨ψ|A^x_a B^y_b|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ̂|Â^x_a B̂^y_b|ψ̂⟩`.

**Proof**: Apply `oneMeasNaimark` separately to each submeasurement
`A^x` (for every question `x`) and `B^y` (for every question `y`).
For each question, this introduces an auxiliary register. The full
lifted state is `ψ ⊗ (⊗_x aux_x) ⊗ (⊗_y aux_y)`, and the dilated
operator `Â^x_a` acts as the Naimark projector on the `x`-th auxiliary
and as the identity on all others. Since different questions use disjoint
auxiliary registers, the per-question identities compose to give the
full joint-probability preservation. -/
/- TODO: Proof applies `oneMeasNaimark` per question per player and composes
   via tensor-product structure. Blocked on `oneMeasNaimark` proof above.
