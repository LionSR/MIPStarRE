# Main-formal soundness theorem

Base handoff, final projective-completion transport, and the paper-facing proof
gap for `thm:main-formal` (`\Cref{thm:main-formal}`).  This module contains:

* `mainFormalBaseRoleResidual` — names the Section 6 role-register residual
  used by the base case `m = 1`.

* `mainFormal_ofProjectiveCompletionResidual` — derives the three consistency
  conclusions of `thm:main-formal` from a constructed Section 6
  projective-completion residual.

* `mainFormal` — the paper theorem statement, taking a projective strategy that
  passes the LID test with probability `≥ 1 − ε`, together with the explicit
  boundary conditions `0 < d`, `0 < k`, and `400md ≤ k`, and producing the three
  pointwise consistency targets at error bound `mainFormalError`.  Its proof is
  currently a direct proof gap rather than a theorem with extra bridge
  hypotheses.  The role-register Section 6 measurement itself is available from
  `MainFormalRolePackageResidual.ofMainInductionLargeK`; the successor part of
  that construction is the tracked `sorry` in the source theorem
  `MainInductionStep.mainInduction`, not an added hypothesis of `mainFormal`.

/-! ### Base handoff and final projective-completion transport

The base branch of `mainFormal` needs a concrete Section 6 role residual and one
post-role projective-completion residual.  Earlier scaffolding expressed this
through separate bridge and obligation packages.  The current public theorem below
does not keep such packages as hypotheses: the theorem remains paper-shaped, and
the missing construction is represented by a direct proof gap. -/


/-- The role-register residual used by the `m = 1` branch of
`mainFormal`.

Supports the base case (`m = 1`) of the main formal theorem
`\label{thm:main-formal}` in `references/ldt-paper/inductive_step.tex`.
The base-case argument uses the residual produced by
`MainFormalRolePackageResidual.ofBaseCase`; this definition names that choice. -/

The residual contains the role-register output and the post-role completion
data.  This theorem performs only the already-formalized final transport and
scalar absorption steps; it does not introduce additional bridge hypotheses. -/

`thm:main-formal` from `test_definition.tex`.

This is the paper theorem statement. The statement includes the large-`k` and
positive-boundary conditions currently needed by the formalization, but it does
not assume the repaired bridge, role-register residual data, or final
projective-completion hypotheses. Those remain open steps to be derived from the
pass condition and the preceding sections.

The hypothesis `hk : 400 * params.m * params.d ≤ k`, together with `hk0`,
records the strengthened boundary from issue #906 and
`rem:main-formal-k-boundary`; the paper states the weaker condition `k ≥ md`.
The field model is presently fixed at universe level `0`, matching the current
Section 6 successor theorem rather than an additional mathematical restriction.

**Proof gap:** the paper-facing statement is restored without bridge, residual,
repair, or obligation hypotheses.  The Section 6 role-register residual is now
obtained by applying the theorem `MainInductionStep.mainInduction`
through `MainFormalRolePackageResidual.ofMainInductionLargeK`; its successor
case remains the tracked `sorry` in Section 6.  The remaining Section 3 work is
to construct the post-role projective-completion residual from the paper
hypotheses, then apply `mainFormal_ofProjectiveCompletionResidual` for the
already-proved final transport.  This is tracked by #1043, #1363, and #1458.
