# Matrix-valued measurements for the MIP*=RE project

This file provides the matrix-valued measurement layer used by the LDT formalization.

## Main definitions

* `Submeasurement` — a family of PSD matrices summing to at most the identity.
* `Measurement` — a family of PSD matrices summing to exactly the identity.
* `Submeasurement.postprocess` — data-processed submeasurements via answer relabeling.
* `Measurement.postprocess` — the paper's postprocessing proposition for complete POVMs.
* `inconsistency` — the off-diagonal mass `∑_{a ≠ b} τ(M_a N_b)`.
* `diagOverlap` — the diagonal mass `∑_a τ(M_a N_a)`.

/-! ## Submeasurements and measurements -/

/--
A submeasurement on a finite answer type `α` is a family of PSD matrices
`M : α → Op d` with `∑ a, M a ≤ 1`.

structure Submeasurement (α : Type*) [Fintype α] (d : Type*) [Fintype d] [DecidableEq d] where
  /-- The effect operators. -/
  effect : α → Op d
  /-- Each effect is positive semidefinite. -/
  pos : ∀ a, 0 ≤ effect a
  /-- The effects sum to at most the identity. -/
  sum_le_one : ∑ a, effect a ≤ 1

/--
A measurement is a submeasurement whose effects sum exactly to the identity.

/-- The total operator `∑ a, M_a`. -/
noncomputable def total (M : Submeasurement α d) : Op d :=
  ∑ a, M.effect a

/--
Data processing: relabel the answer set by `f : α → β`, summing the effects over
fibers.
-/
noncomputable def postprocess [DecidableEq α] [DecidableEq β]
    (M : Submeasurement α d) (f : α → β) : Submeasurement β d where
  effect b := ∑ a ∈ Finset.univ.filter (fun a => f a = b), M.effect a
  pos b := Finset.sum_nonneg fun a _ => M.pos a
  sum_le_one := by
    calc
      ∑ b, ∑ a ∈ Finset.univ.filter (fun a => f a = b), M.effect a
          = ∑ a, M.effect a := Finset.sum_fiberwise Finset.univ f M.effect
      _ ≤ 1 := M.sum_le_one

/--
Build a complete measurement from effects whose sum is exactly the identity.

This constructor keeps the equality proof as the primary hypothesis and derives
the inherited submeasurement inequality automatically.  It is useful at paper
sites that are explicitly POVMs rather than relaxed sub-POVMs.

  effect := effect
  pos := pos
  sum_le_one := le_of_eq sum_eq_one
  sum_eq_one := sum_eq_one

/-- The named total of a complete measurement is the identity. -/
theorem total_eq_one (M : Measurement α d) :
    M.toSubmeasurement.total = 1 := by
  rw [Submeasurement.total, M.sum_eq_one]

/--
Postprocess a complete measurement by relabeling outcomes.

This formalizes `references/ldt-paper/preliminaries.tex:169--180`: regrouping
the effects along the fibers of `f` preserves the total operator, so a POVM
remains a POVM after postprocessing.
