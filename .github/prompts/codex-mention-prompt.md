Instructions:
1. Read the full context with `gh`: triggering comment/review/issue body, the surrounding thread, the PR diff if applicable, and any relevant source files.
   - PR comment: `gh pr view <num> --json ...` and `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<num>/comments`.
   - Issue comment / issue: `gh issue view <num> --json ...`.
   - Review: read all threads via `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<num>/reviews`.
2. Decide whether the request is a question (reply only) or a code change (edit + commit + reply).
3. Use your judgment on whether Mathlib scouting is needed. Warranted for new proofs, closing sorrys, or choosing proof strategies; unnecessary for cosmetic fixes, docstrings, imports, or renaming. When scouting, first read existing **Mathlib Scouting Reports** in PR/issue comments, then scout yourself with `exact?`, `apply?`, `rw?`, `simp?`, and by grepping `.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/`. If asked explicitly to scout, post a fresh **Mathlib Scouting Report** with sections: Relevant Mathlib definitions, Relevant Mathlib lemmas/theorems, Relevant MIPStarRE definitions, Suggested approach, Gaps to fill.
4. For code changes:
   - On a PR: check out the PR's head branch (`gh pr checkout <num>`), edit, run `lake build` to verify zero errors and zero new `sorry`s, commit with prefix `[codex]`, push.
   - On an issue: create a new branch `codex/issue-<NUMBER>-<short-description>` from main, edit, build, commit with prefix `[codex]`, push.
5. Reply via `gh pr comment <num>` or `gh issue comment <num>` summarizing what you did or answering the question. For review-thread triggers, reply directly to the triggering thread.
6. Do NOT resolve review threads — leave resolution to humans or the automated review workflow.

Quality bar (your work MUST satisfy ALL of these before committing):
- Proof integrity (BLOCKER): no `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide` on non-trivial goals, `unsafeCast`, or new axioms. See docs/PROOF_INTEGRITY.md.
- Proof correctness (BLOCKER): structured proofs, not brute-force `simp`/`omega`/`ring` chains. If a result looks wrong, too strong, or suspiciously general, scout `references/ldt-paper/` for the original LDT theorem statements and proofs, compare hypotheses/conclusions, and cite the source path, line range, and label.
- Statement faithfulness (BLOCKER): for any declaration named as, linked to, or documented as a paper theorem, do not add bridge, residual, repair, package, producer, or arbitrary hypothesis inputs unless they are faithful formal encodings of the cited paper statement. If the proof is blocked, stop and report the missing lemma or create a separately named conditional helper; do not change the paper theorem into a conditional theorem.
- Mathlib style: camelCase defs, snake_case lemmas, minimal imports, no unnecessary opens, prefer `exact` over `apply` + `rfl`.
- Type safety (BLOCKER): no universe issues, missing `[DecidableEq]`/`[Fintype]` instances, or coercion-chain unification failures.
- Performance: avoid `decide` on large types, unbounded `simp` sets, deep `rw` chains, `norm_num` on symbolic expressions.
- Modularity: keep new lemmas general; do not duplicate existing Mathlib results.
- Documentation: new definitions and key theorems get docstrings that explain mathematical meaning, not Lean syntax.
- Blueprint sync: when adding or completing (removing `sorry` from) theorems/lemmas/defs, update the corresponding `blueprint/src/chapter/` entry — add `\lean{DeclarationName}` and `\leanok` tags for new results, or add `\leanok` to `\begin{proof}` for newly proven results.
If you cannot satisfy a BLOCKER category, STOP and post a comment explaining the obstacle instead of pushing a half-fix.

Before changing theorem statements, first compare source-labelled statements with
`references/ldt-paper/`.  Do not add bridge, residual, repair, package,
producer, or arbitrary hypothesis inputs to a paper-labelled theorem in order to
make the proof close.  If such an input is genuinely needed, state a separately
named conditional helper and report the paper-faithful theorem as the remaining
proof obligation.  Do not leave unrelated new sorrys.
